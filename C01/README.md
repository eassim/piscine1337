# C01
This is my C01 from the 1337 / 42 Piscine.
It contains the solutions I submitted during the Piscine, along with explanations, resources and tips!

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
- Pointers and pointer manipulation
- Passing and returning results via function parameters
- String output with `write`
- Counting string length manually
- Reversing arrays in place
- Sorting arrays in ascending order

## ðŸ’¡ Tips
- Understand how pointers work before diving into multi-level pointer exercises â€” draw diagrams if necessary.
- For `ft_swap`, remember you are swapping *values*, not addresses.
- When implementing `ft_div_mod` and `ft_ultimate_div_mod`, watch out for division by zero.
- In `ft_putstr`, loop until you reach the null terminator `'\0'`.
- For `ft_strlen`, donâ€™t count the null terminator.
- In `ft_rev_int_tab` and `ft_sort_int_tab`, test with arrays of size 0, 1, and already sorted arrays to catch edge cases.
