This repository contains my solutions for the **42 Piscine** at **1337 Campus** in Rabat.
It was a beautiful learning experience, and I hope it serves as a resource for future poolers.
I’ve added resources and tips that I found important along the way.

⚠️ **Note:** Solely copying solutions from this repo (or any other source) is a **really bad idea**.
You’re here to **get inspiration and guidance when you’re stuck**, not to skip learning.

## 📝 Exams

- **Register** for the exam.
- Do **not** log in with your regular session — log in as `exam` instead, then type `examshell` in the terminal.
- Dedicate **one day before the exam** to preparation:
  - Redo problems from previous days.
  - Solve similar problems.
  - Look up previous exam problems.
- **Don’t push unless you’re sure**:
  - `grademe` timeout increases with each push, eventually becoming unbearable.
- Use **traces** to your advantage — they are there for a reason.
- Work on **main function arguments** beforehand — they are tested in the exam before you encounter them in the days.

## 📈 Progression Plan

**Don’t submit what you don’t understand.** Go at your own pace.
Here’s my recommended schedule:

**Week 1:** `Shell00`, `C00`, `Shell01`
**Week 2:** `C01`, `C02`, `C03`, `C04`
**Week 3:** `C06`, `C07`, `C05`
**Week 4:** `C08`, `C09`, `C11`

⚠️ **Why skip C10?**
It’s extremely hard and time-consuming. Nobody in my pool managed to push it in time.
If you have time at the end of the Piscine, invest it in **preparing for the final exam** instead.
