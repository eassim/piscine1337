# C00
This is my C00 from the 1337 / 42 Piscine.
It contains the solutions I submitted during the Piscine, along with explanations, resources and tips!

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
- Basic Output with write
- Characters and ASCII
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Function Basics
- Combinatorics in C
- Recursion

## ðŸ”— Useful Resources
- **System Calls & C Basics**
  - [`write` manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)
  - [ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com/)

- **Loops & Conditionals**
  - [C Loops â€“ GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-while-loop/)
  - [C If-Else â€“ GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-making-c-cpp/)

- **Recursion**

## Tips
- If you get stuck on the second half of the problems, you can always push and comeback later!
- Always test your code by running norminette and comparing your outputs with the provided examples.
- The last problems on this day are really not intuitive, don't worry if you spend sometime on them. I would recommend trying to understand others' solutions and then implementing them rather than trying to come up with your own.
