## Tips
- Learn more about git it's gonna be a life saver.
- It's totally okay not to do all exercises for the Shell days, validating is good enough as you don't build on this for nearly all other days in the pool.
- It's time consuming to try to solve the problems on your own, I recommend trying for a few minutes then look up the solution, understand it, memorize it, implement it and move on.
